        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is John Ortmann, but I go by "Johnny". I'm originally from New
          York, then spent most of my life in Florida, but now I live in
          Southern California (unfortunately).

          I've been here the past seven years, during that time I got married
          and bought a home. I have an english bulldog
       named Turkey, she's one of the most hyper dogs I've ever met.</p>

        <p>
          I'm a big sports fan. My favorite teams are the Vikings and the Mets.
        </p>
        <p>I don't admit to being a Knicks fan because they are a disgrace.</p>
        <p>
          My favorite sport is baseball. Every year for the past 12 years, I
          watch about 130 Mets games.

        <p>
          I've decided to change my career a few months ago. All of my
          professional life ive been in sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started selling suits, to most recently running the sales and
          finance department for a car dealership. This was a big decision
        </p>
        <p>
          for me because I was already making good money. What really sparked
          the wanting a change was I was scared of what would
        </p>
        <p>
          happen to the car industry in the next 10 years and didn't want to
          have search for a new career then. So I felt I should be safe
        </p>
        <p>
          and start sooner than later. Three of my friends, my brother in-law,
          and wife all have tech jobs so they were really my inspiration to
        </p>
        <p>
          look into this career. I'm used to working 6 days a week 60 hour
          weeks, so im most looking forward to being able to work from home.
